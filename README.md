A game i was making in like 2016...


A game i was working on in high-school, 
All art are from random places on internet... i have no source, sorry...

the main idea, was to create a game where you have no limit on items races and soo on,
so basically a mod viable game,

all items are created on load... (not really smart).
it loads items from Appdata, on phone or windows.
it takes a minute+- to load all sprites, create from them items and add to the game.( it does it every time you load...)
it generate single sprites from the sprite sheet on load,
then saves them into dictionary
with something like  <Name, < Frame, Sprite>>

An animator script i made to animate all the sprites.
again loads it from dictionarry in each point.
Works quite well but well it could have been much better but oh i made it like 4 years ago...

There is some inventory system, so you can pick items equip etc...
There is a Stats system, so you have stats like agility strength magic etc...
that effected by the item you wear.

Also, Attacks, Arrows, and 1 Spell.
All works quite good with some damage.

Also a way to create a Bot, that just randomly tries to kill everyone he see.

Also A* path finding system, that i used and wrote via some youtube tutorial on A*, (Probably Sebastian Lague).

the reason i didnt continue it?
was well because i wanted to make it 3D with a mix of 2D and at the time
i had issues with it i coudnt really figure out how to fix.
Also coudnt really think of what next to add i guess.
